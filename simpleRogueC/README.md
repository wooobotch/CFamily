Hi there!

Don't pay much attention to this repo. Probably there is a lot of broken stuff; it's only goal is to help me keep track of some training I'm doing to build up again some C knowledge.

What should you expect to find here?
* Book's exercises (I have a library with lots of old books like **The C Programming Language** by Kerninghan and Ritchie).
* Uncommon projects (Ever tried _boids_ and _voxels_ at the same time?).
* Actual useful code I hope I use IRL (Like Unity DOTS/ECS but of my own, in C).
* ~~Things that may come out nice for a portfolio.~~ 

About the license, feel free to do anything with my code, my pick was not totally random because I had to consider the fact that I will eventually include some code to run on Unity.
